Extended Metadata for Wordpress and Pressbooks

## Description

Wordpress gives you the ability to add metadata to your sites thus helping Google and other search engines to recognise it. The problem comes if you want to expand.

All in one metadata, extends the functionality of Wordpress and gives you the flexibility to add more metadata in your sites, taking advantage of the schema markup.

You can see the [schema properties that we use here](https://github.com/Books4Languages/pressbooks-metadata/blob/master/docs/SchemaUsed.md)
